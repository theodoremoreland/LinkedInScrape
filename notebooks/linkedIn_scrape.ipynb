      "10mo10 months\"What holds women back at work is not some unique challenge of balancing the demands of work and family but rather a general problem of overwork that prevails in contemporary corporate culture. Women and men alike suffer as a result. But women pay higher professional costs.\n",

      "\n",
      "Whether it be long hours, or life on the road, I've personally watched these demands tear apart families and marriages. Social expectations push women to bear it by compromising their careers, but men bear it by not being present to their families, who also suffer as a result.\n",

      "10mo • Edited10 monthsI’d love to share a personal story that to date I’ve literally never experienced. My partner and I picked up a gross airport sickness (influenza-A and pneumonia for Omi and the common cold for me) with the news of what’s going around we did what we thought was best: staying home, notifying our employers and getting tested. Luckily has a policy that our sick time is paid and doesn’t come out of our PTO, why because they want us to stay home, rest, and come back ready to go! That is something I never had in any of my other jobs, but that wasn’t the most touching part. My managing director and one of our founders, Sean Walsh, kept in touch with me, checking in on how we were doing, how he & the labs can help, what the results of our tests were, & how I would like this to be handled should we get the bad news that it was not just the flu. Today I am grateful for our illnesses not being worse and for being treated like a human. I’m grateful that “work life balance” & that “team members and our culture are the foundation of 1904labs” are not just empty platitudes to lure in exceptionally brilliant people.\n",

      "1yr1 yearAt 1904labs, we do a lot of really cool advanced engineering. In my space, it's all about data engineering. When we initially meet with new clients or check in with existing ones, we find ourselves asking some of the same questions. They are usually: \"Are we meeting your expectations?\", \"Are you on the path you need to be on to be successful?\", \"What are the capabilities you are trying to unlock for your business?\", \"How do you feel about your current tools and processes now?\", etc. We constantly ask these questions because we want to understand the \"As-Is\" and \"To-Be\" roads for each client/project. Because of that, we thought it would be fun to build a \"Modern technology maturity survey\". Its an automated survey that asks some of the above questions, but you get a maturity score and potential roadmap at the end.
