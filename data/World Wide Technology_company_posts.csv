Our nurses are the lifeline and spine of our NHS, and to support them we are raising funds which will be donated to NHS Charities Together. This year, with nurses on the frontlines of the battle against COVID-19, it seems especially important to salute nurses and give our most sincere thanks for the extraordinary job they are doing.

We are taking part in a Virtual Team Race to Mount Everest in aid of the Association of NHS Charities; whereby each member of the team will be walking 58,070 steps by next Monday. We would be grateful if you can sponsor us so we can give back to the frontline workers who have not only worked tirelessly and selflessly through this pandemic, but also taken personal risks under extraordinary stress.

Thanks in advance for your contribution to this cause. Please share at will and stay safe!
