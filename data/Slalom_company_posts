Amer Numan
‚Ä¢ 3rd+
Data & Analytics Leader
4mo ‚Ä¢ Edited4 monthsI spoke to NBC News about the burnout we‚Äôre all experiencing during the pandemic recently, and the research is quite sobering. An industry survey by Fishbowl reveals that:

69% of workers are reporting tangible & serious burnout after more than 5 months of working virtually. üíª

55% report working more hours than they ever did before the pandemic. ‚è∞

37% are actively looking to switch jobs. üëã

It‚Äôs time for companies to find that balance and flexibility that the workforce requires, to accept a virtual future, or their top talent WILL get that flexibility and balance elsewhere.

I‚Äôm thankful that was one of the first companies in the industry to guarantee no layoffs, honor promotions during the pandemic, and offer options to virtually select work that you want to do, without geographic borders. This eliminated fear, doubt and anxiety really early, and assured people that the company can be flexible to meet the time we're in.

Marcelo Somers

UX Manager, Inventory Management at Shopify
10mo10 months""What holds women back at work is not some unique challenge of balancing the demands of work and family but rather a general problem of overwork that prevails in contemporary corporate culture. Women and men alike suffer as a result. But women pay higher professional costs.

If we want to solve this problem, we must reconsider what we‚Äôre willing to allow the workplace to demand of all employees.""

Some eye-opening research from HBR that when companies set out to fix gender equality, and are confronted that the issue is a general culture of overwork that affects both women and men, they'll do everything they can to justify it.

Whether it be long hours, or life on the road, I've personally watched these demands tear apart families and marriages. Social expectations push women to bear it by compromising their careers, but men bear it by not being present to their families, who also suffer as a result.

Thankfully, I've ""taken the red pill"" by working for who reinvented the consulting model 20 years ago. No more grueling hours and road warrior lifestyle. Live and work in your city, care for your people with reasonable hours, and deliver amazing outcomes for our clients. You don't have to compromise.

10mo10 monthsInteresting event today hosted by the folks at Slalom consulting. The challenges and approaches to enterprise data transformation were discussed, with input from Snowflake, Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Tableau Software.

Key takeaways were:
üëâThe average lifespan of a fortune 500 company is 14 years, due to the disruption from technology
üëâ 92% of companies fail to successfully scale data analytics
üëâ A vision and cultural change are required for a successful transformation, backed up with a focus on data transparency, guardianship and literacy
üëâ User data is more vulnerable given the large amount of information stored in data lakes ‚Äì techniques such as tokenisation and masking of personal data can be used to address this

Well done to for hosting and , and for their insights.
